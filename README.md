Have you noticed in 1.14.x that Pillagers spawn at an extremely high rate around outposts? Yeah, it ain't fun!

**LessPillagers** is very simple, it will cut down the amount of Pillagers that will spawn near outposts.

This plugin is very lightweight. Theres a config option to determine the max amount of Pillagers per outpost, the default value is 16, and I do not recommend setting it too low. The plugin doesn't actually look for outposts it just counts the amount of pillagers near an attempted spawn. Setting this value too low may cause Pillager spawns across the world to be too low (ie: in raids)

### COMMANDS:
- **pillager-count**: This is a simple command just to count the amount of Pillagers around you (in a 100 block radius by default, it use same radius than the attempted spawn test). It really serves no purpose I just added it for testing the Pillager count
- **pillager-reload**: Reload the plugin configuration

### PERMISSIONS:
- **lesspillagers.command.count**: This is just the permission to run the command **/pillager-count**
- **lesspillagers.command.reload**: Allows to run the command **/pillager-reload**

Check the plugin out on [**SpigotMC**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lesspillagers.70184/)
