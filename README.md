Have you noticed in 1.14.x that Pillagers spawn at an extremely high rate around outposts? Yeah, it ain't fun!

**LessPillagers** is very simple, it will cut down the amount of Pillagers that will spawn near outposts.

This plugin is very lightweight. Theres a config option to determine the max amount of Pillagers per outpost, the default value is 16, and I do not recommend setting it too low. The plugin doesn't actually look for outposts it just counts the amount of pillagers near an attempted spawn. Setting this value too low may cause Pillager spawns across the world to be too low (ie: in raids)

### COMMANDS:
- **pillager-count**: This is a simple plugin just to count the amount of Pillagers in a 100 block radius around you. It really serves no purpose I just added it for testing the Pillager count

### PERMISSIONS:
- **lesspillagers.command.count**: This is just the permission to run the one and only command

Check the plugin out on [**SpigotMC**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lesspillagers.70184/)
